We all have visited hotels from time to time and it's quite clear that resorts charge way more money than city hotels, so ideally they should be more profitable right??
But there's a saying "Slow and Steady Wins The Race"
Just what happened in the case of Hotels, I was comparing 3 years of data from 2015 to 2017, and although Resort type hotels had an average daily rate of almost 90 in 2015 compared to City hotels where the average daily rate was around 85. The differences were drastic in 2016,
City Hotels ~ 103
Resort Hotels ~ 88

Another interesting fact I found was a country like Russia, bigger in size, diversity, and population than Morroco had a standard deviation in the daily rate at around 50 whereas Morroco had around 68.

There's so much to explore with data, the depths are never ending here.
Nevertheless, this was my first ever dashboard on the Tableau
